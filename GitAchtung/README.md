Each player has a different color which identifies him between the other players.
the game starts in the menu screen where you choose your buttons. Those buttons,
while pushed,will change the direction of where your player is advancing. 
While your player is advancing, he leaves a trace of color behind him. 
Your goal is not to touch the boarders of the game, nor not to touch any of your playes traces. For each strike of the other players you get a point and therefore the last man standing wins all the points.

1. clear screen - restart the screen 
2. move fast - your player will move twice as fast from any other player.
